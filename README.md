# mt8163-preloader-missing

I recently flashed my device to a Google pixel 4 and it worked fine. Now something happened and when I turn it on the touch screen works but I can't get the keyboard to come up to login. And now when I plug up to it via OTG it won't recognize as adb device. I can't flash it either or put it into any other mode but Brom mode. And this is what comes up. Please help I believe the preloader crashed somehow.
